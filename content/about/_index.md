Hi! My name is Mehmet Enes, I am currently a Junior Computer Science and Engineering student at Sabanci University, Istanbul Turkey. I am a very eager person to learn new technologies and use that information to complete a puzzle which constructs a big machine that creates beneficial output for people. In my journey I belonged to many teams and led many teams for social events and tech projects. I am experienced at working in a fast changing environment and can easily adapt to the environment with the help of my team. I am able to manage dependencies on myself so that I can create an environment where my colleagues can communicate and work with me in a good environment.

I am currently available for part time remote work, but will be looking for full time employment from summer 2023.

You can have a look at my CV if you want!
