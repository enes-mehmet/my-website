      <description>How did we decide to start this project Before moving on to how I did this project, what technologies I used, etc., I would like to explain the thinking behind this project and how we got to this point in this project. Almost all of us have a relative in our family who uses some type of medicine. Older people, in particular, take more pills than prescribed, take pills more often, and most likely sometimes forget to take their medication, due to different prescriptions.</description>

      <description>I created my portfolio website using Hugo and UIKit, it serves as an online resume containing all my work.
This has been created as a theme so that others can use and adapt it.
Sections Homepage The homepage provides the basic information about you, including links to social media, skills you have, things you&amp;rsquo;ve done and your education. This page makes good use of UIKit grid and cards for organising all the information and ensuring it is responsive to work on mobile devices.</description>
